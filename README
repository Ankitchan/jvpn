jvpn.pl - script to connect to the Juniper firewall with enabled HostChecker.

Features
 * Emulates web browser to get authentication data
 * Automatically starts juniper client and passing data to it using TCP
   connection (it is not possible with command line).
 * Able to download Linux client from the Juniper VPN server without browser or
   Java.
 * Could protect resolv.conf by setting +i attribute for the connection time
 * Works without Java machine on x86 and x86_64 hosts

Requirements 
 * Perl with LWP modules
 * openssl binary
 * unzip (only for unpacking)

Usage
To configure script edit jvpn.ini. If you don`t have installed client - run
jvpn.pl under sudo and it will download and install it automatically. If you 
want to run it without sudo - set suid bit on the "ncsvc" binary.
If you have multiply configurations - use --conf switch to define ini file.

How it works
 1) Script connecting to the VPN web portal with provided user name and password.
 2) Then script handling different authentication scenarios to get DSID value
 3) After getting DSID value script getting md5 fingerprint of the SSL 
    certificate.
 4) If ncsvc client is not installed script downloading and unpacking it. 
 5) Script starting ncsvc and connecting to daemon using 127.0.0.1:4242 address
 6) Script emulates native GUI and passing configuration data to daemon. After
    this step VPN should work.
 7) Script can optionally protect resolv.conf from dhcpd or Network Manager by 
    setting +i flag on it (disabled by default). 
 8) On Ctrl+C script sending "Disconnect" command to the daemon and logging out 
    on the web site.

Bugs and debugging
This script is done without any documentation, only using wireshark and
debugger. It is very likely that it has a bugs or will not work correctly for 
you. If you need some support - enable debug and send me all information.
Script debug is written to stdout and daemon log is written to the
~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc.log file.
